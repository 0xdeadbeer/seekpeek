## About

Seekpeek is a temporary project I have been working on recently. It doesn't have a specific goal in mind. I work on it because I think C is fun and a nice way to strengthen your knowledge about computers. The code is 100% yours and you are free to do whatever you want with it.

Required libraries: 
 - <a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/">GTK4</a>
 - <a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/">Libcurl</a>
 - <a href="https://github.com/lexbor/lexbor">Lexbor</a>

> Before compiling the program make sure you have installed the required libraries onto your system.

Build commands: 
 - `make build` will build the program and store it inside the `build/` directory
 - `make run` will run the program
 - `make all` will do both (first build, then run)

For installation you can either:
 - Build and move the binary into your /bin folder
 - Or download the prebuilt binary and move it into your /bin folder
