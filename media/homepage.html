    <p>Peek and explore the web through a simple and open-source browser.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Seekpeek is a temporary project I have been working on recently. It doesn't have a specific goal in mind. I work on it because I think C is fun and a nice way to strengthen your knowledge about computers. The code is 100% yours and you are free to do whatever you want with it.</p>
